                    <p>What we teach in our classes is to encourage the ability of the student whether child our adult, we
                        focus on developing the technique and speed at a pace they are comfortable. By learning these new
                        techniques and skills along with greater levels of fitness students will eventually aid to grade
                        through the system becoming a blackbelt in kickboxing or kung fu even both. The style of teaching we
                        use will increase your stamina, flexibility, co-ordination and endurance. The style of teaching is
                        to grow and build confidence of the student.

                        prepare them for carrying out pad work drills, striking combinations using speed with power and
                        using effective punching and kicking strikes. The progression made from these classes will
